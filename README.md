# Medical_Drugs_Conditions

### Abstract:


For this project, we will be using Natural Language Processing techniques to evaluate patientâ€™s reviews and ratings of medical conditions and drugs. The data comes from UCI ML which contains over 160k reviews which was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. Below is a sample of the data which has 0 to 10 ratings for a particular drug and condition as well as the comment left by the patient and the number of patients that found the drug useful.

### Design:


 A pipeline was built to collect the data and perform machine learning to predict if the transaction was fraud and deployed an app to show the results.
